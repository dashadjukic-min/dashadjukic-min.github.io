I am a doctoral student of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research interests are at the crossroads of nonprofit organizations and political science, especially international relations. I study immigration (diasporas) and philanthropy (corporate social responsibility).

I work as a Graduate Assistant in the Office of Programs, Assessment and Accreditation, where I assist with projects related to assessment of administrative units and academic programs.
